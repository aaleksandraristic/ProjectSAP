**SQL Server Database Implementation - Student Admissions Portal (SAP)**

The purpose of this project was to create a student admissions portal that allows students to efficiently and quickly submit a college application. 
Students can easily create an account, log in, and submit an application on a website. The front-end application connects to a back-end database system in SQL Server 2022. 
The project resulted in a robust, secure, and efficient Student Admissions Portal, significantly improving the application submission process and providing a reliable backend infrastructure.
